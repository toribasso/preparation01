# Preparation01: Reflection on Grades
## Viktoria Basso

  As an licensed secondary education teacher, I think I have a unique perspective on this article.
  It may surprise many, but I agree with many of the points in the article. For example when Alfie
  Kohn mentioned that "grades tend to diminish students' interest in whatever they're learning" and
  "grades create a preference for the easiest possible task". I had a great passion for teaching 
  biology and tried to make it as interesting as possible and share my passion. I was disappointed with 
  the results. Many of the students were more interested in getting an "A" then actually learning the 
  material. I remember one instance where a student asked me for assistance in raising their grade. I 
  discussed meeting me in their lunch hour for questions, emailing me their questions, or supplementary 
  resources to help their learning. I got disagreement on all of these suggestions. After listening to 
  the student talk with their friends, they were not asking me how to understand the material better, 
  they were asking me for extra credit or corrections. Something easy for them to do to boost their 
  grade. It was disappointing to me. I understand that not all students are going to be passionate in a 
  required course, but I guess I was hoping for more students who like learning for the sake of learning.
   It seems with standardized testing and tough college admissions, some students are playing a numbers 
   game instead of focusing on what they come to school to do, learn.
   
   I also agree that is hard to quantify the how well students are learning or teachers are teaching. 
   Teaching and learning are dynamic processes. For example, any teacher who has received whole-classroom 
   feedback has probably found that all students are different. Some students prefer to read the textbook 
   and others prefer to complete labs. Students also differ in what subsections of class they find interesting.
   In teaching, you cannot please everyone and everyone has a different view on what good teaching is. 
   Some administrators love hands on teachers with lots of labs. Other administrators prefer teachers who 
   have strict classroom management skills and students stay quiet and in their seats. Some prize relationships 
   with the students and others prize control and "keeping them busy".
   
   I truly doubt that the grading system will disappear, but as teachers, we are trying to prepare them to
   be successful participant in the United States society. We try and give them all the tools to live and 
   thrive. I agree with Alfie Kohn that a portfolio would be much better than grades to show all that you 
   have learned and what you can do. Is that not how the job market works to this day? You show what you 
   can do. Not facts and ideas that you most likely forgot about within 3 months of completing the course. 
   This would be much more profitable for the student and show the student how the job market works. This 
   is truly leading them to success, rather than giving them a grade and moving them on to forget what you 
   taught them.
